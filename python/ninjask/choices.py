"""Enumerate legal choices from a Showdown request (doubles and singles).

A request is the JSON a player receives in ``|request|``. Choice strings use
Showdown's syntax: ``move 2 1``, ``move 1 -2 mega``, ``switch 3``, ``pass``,
joined with ``, `` across active slots, and ``team 1234`` at preview.

Targets in doubles: foes are 1 and 2 (their slots), allies are -1 and -2
(our own slots). Moves whose target type needs no choice take no target.
