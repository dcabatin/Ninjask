## What this changes

## Checks

- [ ] `check_reference.py --synthetic --games 200` matches every game
- [ ] Fingerprint: unchanged (`6e2f85907f97e4e9`), or changed because behaviour changed, and that change matches Showdown (explained above)
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has a line under "Unreleased", if a user would notice
