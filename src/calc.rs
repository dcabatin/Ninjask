//! Exact damage, accuracy, KO chances and turn order, read-only.
//!
//! What an expert computes in their head, from the engine's own code: the
//! damage of a move is `getDamage`'s two phases (`Battle::damage_base`
//! before the random roll, `Battle::damage_mods` after it), run for each
//! of the 16 rolls with and without a critical hit, so the calculation and
//! the battle can't drift apart. Everything the engine models applies:
//! abilities, items, weather and terrain, screens, a pending Helping Hand,
//! boosts, burns, the spread reduction when a spread move has two targets,
//! Parental Bond's second hit, multi-hit moves.
//!
//! The functions take `&mut Battle` for the engine's handlers but leave the
//! battle as they found it: they run with the battle in *probe* mode, where
//! nothing is drawn for an outcome (Fickle Beam takes its usual power), no
//! berry is eaten (its effect still applies), nothing is logged, and the RNG
//! and every state they touch are restored. The `&self` forms work on a copy.
//!
//! The probabilities assume the battle as it stands: the move used now, on
//! this target, with nothing else happening first.
//!
//! - **KO this turn**: the move hits (its accuracy) and its total damage
//!   reaches the target's current HP, critical hits included. A Sturdy or
//!   Focus Sash holder at full HP (or one under Endure) survives the first
//!   hit, a Focus Band holder one time in ten, and an intact Disguise takes
//!   the first hit.
//! - **2HKO**: two uses of the move, each landing with its accuracy,
//!   without anything in between: no end-of-turn damage or healing, no stat
//!   changes, the same field.
