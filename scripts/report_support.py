"""How much of a Reg M-C team pool does the engine support?

Reads a team pool (by default <data>/teams/<format>-pastes.txt, one packed team per line), asks the engine which
moves, items and abilities each team uses that it can't simulate, and ranks
the blockers greedily: the entity whose port would make the most teams fully
supported comes first, then the next given the first, and so on. Writes
support-<format>.json, and the fully supported teams (a pool to train on)
to teams/supported-pool.txt, in the data directory (ninjask.paths:
data/derived/).

Usage:
    python scripts/report_support.py --pool teams.txt
